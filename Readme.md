# CSL215 - Digital Logic and System Design

These are some assignments made in my Digital Logic and System design course. These are written in [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL) and have corresponding .xdc files and can be run on an [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array#:~:text=A%20field%2Dprogrammable%20gate%20array,term%20%22field%2Dprogrammable%22.) board.
